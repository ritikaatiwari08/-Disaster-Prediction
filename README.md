## Overview
The AI-Based Disaster Prediction and Response System leverages Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to predict natural disasters and enhance response efforts. It focuses on forecasting floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes, and provides tools to assist victims post-disaster.

## Features
- **Flood Prediction Model:** Analyzes weather patterns, river levels, and precipitation data to forecast potential flooding events.
- **Earthquake Prediction Model:** Utilizes seismic activity and geological data to predict earthquakes and their impacts.
- **Hurricane Prediction Model:** Uses atmospheric data and ocean temperatures to predict hurricanes and their trajectories.

## Chatbase API Integration
Integrated with Chatbase API for a chat-based interface, offering real-time responses and information.

## YOLOv5 Model for Post-Disaster Response
YOLOv5 object detection model analyzes imagery and videos to locate and identify victims for rescue operations.

## Technology Stack
- **Machine Learning Models:** Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn.
- **Chatbase API:** For responsive chat interactions.
- **YOLOv5:** Real-time object detection.
- **Frontend and Backend:** HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js.

## How It Works
### Prediction Phase:
1. **Data Collection:** Gather data from weather stations, seismic sensors, etc.
2. **Model Training:** Train models with historical data.
3. **Prediction:** Provide early warnings for disasters.

### Response Phase:
1. **Chat Interface:** Real-time updates and safety advice.
2. **Victim Detection:** YOLOv5 processes images and videos to locate victims.

## Prerequisites
- Git, Git LFS, Python, pip, Node.js, npm.
